<H2 align="left" style="color:white">Varients of Corona</H2><b>
<li align="left" style="color:white">Delta
<p align="left" style="color:white">The Delta variant is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was first detected in India in late 2020. The Delta variant was named on 31 May 2021 and had spread to over 179 countries by 22 November 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated in June 2021 that the Delta variant was becoming the dominant strain globally.</p>
<H2 align="left" style="color:white">Symptoms</H2><b>
<p align="left" style="color:white">There have been reports of symptoms that are different than those associated with the original coronavirus strain, Dr. Yildirim says. “It seems like cough and loss of smell are less common,” she says. “And headache, sore throat, runny nose, and fever are present based on surveys in the U.K.”</p>
<li align="left" style="color:white">Omicron
<p align="left" style="color:white">The Omicron variant is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) that was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from South Africa on 24 November 2021. On 26 November 2021, WHO designated it as a variant of concern and named it "Omicron" after the fifteenth letter in the Greek alphabet. Omicron was first detected on 22 November 2021 in laboratories in Botswana and South Africa based on samples collected on 11–16 November. The first known sample was collected in South Africa on 8 November. The first known case, outside of South Africa, was a person arriving in Hong Kong from South Africa via Qatar on 11 November, and another person who arrived in Belgium from Egypt via Turkey on the same date. As of 7 January 2022, the variant has been confirmed in 135 countries. Omicron has an unusually large number of mutations compared to previous variants. Several of the mutations are novel and involve changes to the spike protein reducing the ability for COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic disease. Vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe disease and hospitalisation especially after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is given.One hypothesis to explain the novel mutations is that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from humans to mice and mutated in a population of mice sometime between mid-2020 and late 2021 before reinfecting humans.</p>
<H2 align="left" style="color:white">Symptoms</H2><b>
<p  align="left" style="color:white">A U.K. study of around 750,000 people found recently that the top five symptoms for both the Delta and Omicron variants are currently a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and a sore throat.</p>

<H2 align="left" style="color:white">Vaccines in India</H2><b>
<li align="left" style="color:white">Sputnik<b>
<p align="left" style="color:white">Sputnik V (Russian: Спутник V, brand name from RDIF) or Gam-COVID-Vac (Russian: Гам-КОВИД-Вак, the real name of the vaccine under which it is registered and produced[3]) is an adenovirus viral vector vaccine for COVID-19 developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia. It is the world's first registered combination vector vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19, having been registered on 11 August 2020 by the Russian Ministry of Health.</p><b>
<li align="left" style="color:white">Covaxin<b>
<p align="left" style="color:white">Covaxin (codenamed as BBV152) is an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Virology.</p><b>
<li align="left" style="color:white">Covi-shield<b>
<p align="left" style="color:white">A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19)</p><b>
