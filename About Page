<P style="color:white">Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but do not infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begins to infect humans. In the case of COVID-19, the first people infected in Wuhan, China are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals. Although researchers don t know exactly how people were infected, they already have evidence that the virus can be spread directly from person to person through close contact.</p>

<H1 STYLE="background-color:lightyellow;color:green">How it spreads</h1>

<P style="color:white">COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). The virus travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.<br>




</center><ul style="color:white">COVID-19 is likely spread:<br>

<li>The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within 6 feet). You may be infected if you inhale these droplets.<br>
<li>You can also get COVID-19 from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person and then touching your face.<br>
<li>It s considered possible to get COVID-19 after touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands. But it s thought to be unlikely.</P>

<SUMMARY>Introduction</SUMMARY>
<p style="color:black">
 We re not just fighting an epidemic; we re fighting an infodemic 1, the director general of the WHO declared in February 2020, highlighting for example, facts instead of fear, and rationality instead of rumors. Since then, the spread of false and misleading information about COVID-19 on social media has only intensified (Brennen et al., 2020). This potentially stokes public anxiety, which might further escalate into collective panic or other negative collective behaviors that health organizations want to avoid. Such concerns build on, for instance, survey studies that find a negative relationship between health-protective behaviors of citizens and exposure to COVID-19 misinformation (i.e. conspiracy beliefs) and that such exposure is higher when using social media as a source of information (e.g. Allington et al., 2020). Existing studies have also added understandings of how misinformation from debunked stories in general spread faster than non-debunked stories on Twitter (Vosoughi et al., 2018) and detailed accounts of the pattern and logics of spread have been made in particular on specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories and associated hashtags (e.g. Gruzd and Mai, 2020), hinting at the importance to study and detect misinformation. In addition, studies have examined emotions in social media at scale during the pandemic (Xue et al., 2020), however, without a focus on misinformation. Furthermore, studies show that negative sentiments related to communication about conspiracies and science, spread over time, where communication about conspiracy is more negative (Zollo et al., 2015) and that negative information can spread for a longer time in comparison to neutral or positive information (Ku en and Strembeck, 2018). Emotions also play an important role in misleading the reader with false information and in detecting misinformation (Ghanem et al., 2020). Thus, veracity and emotional valence affect how information spreads, to what extent receivers are deceived and which sentiments are elicited. Knowledge about valence also helps to detect false information. Regarding COVID-19 misinformation, however, knowledge is missing about emotional valence associated with different types of misinformation. Our aim is to fill this gap and contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 misinformation by looking at the extent of misinformation and associated emotional valence as one potential factor influencing spreading on social media. Our focus on COVID-19-related misinformation and its emotional valence is sparked by inconsistencies on the amount and character of misinformation and emotions in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. Brennen et al., 2020; Kouzy et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020). We examine a similar period as these studies, but contribute to the field with a more content-sensitive perspective.<br></details>

<SUMMARY>How Is The Outspread Of Misleading Facts Are Affecting The Pendamic's Societal Response??</SUMMARY>
<p style="color:black">
The confluence of misinformation and infectious disease isn t unique to COVID-19. Misinformation contributed to the spread of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and it plagues efforts to educate the public on the importance of vaccinating against measles. But when it comes to COVID-19, the pandemic has come to be defined by a tsunami of persistent misinformation to the public on everything from the utility of masks and the efficacy of school closures, to the wisdom behind social distancing, and even the promise of untested remedies. According to a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, areas of the country exposed to television programming that downplayed the severity of the pandemic saw greater numbers of cases and deaths because people didn t follow public health precautions.

In the United States, misinformation spread by elements of the media, by public leaders and by individuals with large social media platforms has contributed to a disproportionately large share of COVID-19 burden: we house 4 percent of the global population but account for 22 percent of global COVID-19 deaths. With winter around the corner and people spending more time indoors, it is more imperative than ever that we counter misinformation and clearly communicate risks to the public; in addition, as we await the arrival of a vaccine, it is equally important to arm the public with facts. We have work to do: a recent poll found that just half of the American public plans to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Below are some key recommendations for the science community, public health professionals, members of the public, and industry on what they can do to effectively blunt the effect of misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 response.

A coordinated campaign of influencers supporting science and public health. A study of COVID-19 messaging on social media revealed misinformation from politicians, celebrities and other prominent figures made up about 20 percent of claims but accounted for 69 percent of total social media engagement. Therefore, public health figures who have credibility must partner with social media influencers who have the reach. Harnessing the wide reach of local, regional and national influencers from a wide swath of sectors both within and outside of the public health community is necessary to counter the large volume of misinformation thrust into the information ecosystem. A coordinated campaign of influencers that combines subject matter experts with entertainers, political figures, businesspeople and civil society sectors will help to amplify consistent public health guidance across social media, digital and traditional media outlets.

An aggressive and transparent effort by social media companies working in cooperation with governments to remove markedly false information regarding COVID-19. The single largest category of misleading or false claims (39 percent) are mischaracterizations or misleading messages about actions or policies of public authorities. Although social media companies are increasing their efforts to remove misinformation regarding COVID-19 from their platforms, their efforts are largely reactive and delayed, during which damaging information circulates among unwitting viewers. That s why public health officials must work with social media companies through robust partnerships in order to identify common sources of misinformation; proactively anticipate future misinformation from those sources; and enable its removal in a near real-time fashion. To be credible, this process must be robust, transparent and nonpartisan.

Beyond debunking and removal of false information: a robust public messaging campaign that goes further than the government s traditional one-way message. Social media is popular because it provides individuals, groups and institutions the opportunity to have dynamic conversations. However, public health messages from officials typically need to be cleared through a lengthy review process that does not allow officials to converse in real time with audiences in order to educate and debunk misinformation. To be more effective, public health officials should develop standards and guidance that allows them to dynamically interact with the public in a more timely fashion. Dynamic conversations and proactive messaging between public health officials and the public can be more impactful than removing false information from social media platforms, especially since removal typically occurs long after a significant number of individuals have already been exposed to the false message. A more promising approach is for public health officials and science- and health-based institutions to provide the public with a steady stream of facts.

Detect, understand and expose COVID-19-related misinformation through data science and behavioral analytics. Any effort aimed at conveying facts to large audiences requires harnessing and understanding audience data. This is what makes the advertisement industry so powerful. Unfortunately, our public health communicators have not adopted basic capabilities to which industry is accustomed.  These capabilities include understanding the preferences of various sectors of the public active on social media platforms so as to deliver timely and salient information that resonate with them. These are capabilities routinely used by the ad industry, and they would serve the public health sector well in its effort to better understand audiences and in order to persuade them in favor of preferred behaviors.

Match public health promises with the capabilities of a government that can deliver Lessons from past public health mass media campaigns indicate that any advice from public health officials must be matched with the ability to deliver services to those audiences. For example, guidance for testing must be accompanied by readily accessible COVID-19 tests. Guidance for wearing masks must be met with ample availability of masks. And any education campaign on the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics must be met with a sufficient availability and affordability of those measures.</p><br><br>

<h1 style="background-color:lightyellow;color:green">Positive Impacts</h1>

<h3 style="color:white">
<li align="left">People may be attracted to traditional foods and consumption practices mainly based on the human family. Intergenerational social integrity will strengthen and be consolidated by youths. There will be a lesser demand for restaurants and hotel sector supply chains in each level such as national, regional and global due to the social and physical distancing.
<li align="left">Decline in defence expenditure at national and global levels and minimising the need or requirements in the arms race, especially in nuclear weaponry systems, at least on a temporary basis. Thus, war fear could be minimised in certain regions. This may in turn influence international terrorism and its supply chain networks.
<li align="left">New ideological constructions in many critical subject disciplines, such as medicine, economics, political science, sociology, psychology, robotic sciences, religious and humanistic sciences. Hence, research and development activities will expand in every country.
<li align="left">Developments in sociological tool-kits and social engineering skills to deliver efficient services through supply chain networks and management of patients and general public.
<li align="left">People getting used to do some optional analysis and adapt to follow optimum use of resources, economising resources, and sustainable approaches to satisfy their need structure. These trends may reorganise the supply chain networks in national and regional levels.
<li align="left">General public may develop some positive altitudes over the special duties performed by various essential services in society, especially, health workers, social workers, police and armed forces who are involved in quarantine processes, etc. However, there should be very efficient supply chains to maintain these services in optimum operation when necessary to society, particularly, in South Asia.

<center><h1 style="background-color:lightyellow;color:green">Negative Impacts</h1>

<h3 style="color:white">
<li align="left">If the government and its subordinate authorities face some inadequate workable decisions or binding decisions and poor policy applications, it may lead to political instability in society. These conflicts of interests may cause political changes in society.
<li align="left">Social unrest, stress and social stigma amongst the family members due to their detachment from family as a result of local and international migration. This may get aggravated further through the suspension of continental air transportation under lock-down situations.
<li align="left">Disruptions in the productions of primary and secondary items in the society. Especially, issues in the production of primary items may lead to social unrest in society. Less demand and lack of proper supply chain networks may aggravate the existing unrest level.
<li align="left">There are many people who are losing their jobs and incomes in the formal and informal sectors in the society.
<li align="left">Service providers  (supply chain networks) inability to continue the day-to-day supply of commodities and other services due to the lack of profit margins. It may lead to detachments from such entities or services, and some people may find alternative solutions. Thus, there may be some temporal decline in supply chains in society.
<li align="left">People might depend on rumours and other informal channels of information if there is a chaotic condition in formation channels or the dissemination of information. Especially, if there are some loop halls in supply chain networks, these rumours may work rapidly with different social and economic impacts.
